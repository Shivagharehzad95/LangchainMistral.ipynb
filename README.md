# LangchainMistral.ipynbLangChain + Mistral AI Tutorial 🚀

This project is a Jupyter/Colab notebook demonstrating how to use LangChain with Mistral AI models for building practical NLP applications. It walks through the basics of connecting to Mistral, running queries, streaming results, and chaining outputs for more complex workflows.

📌 Features

🔑 Setup with API key (Mistral console integration)

⚡ Streaming responses from Mistral models

🌍 Text translation using LangChain pipelines

🔗 Chaining with parsers for structured outputs

📄 Summarization of text documents with LangChain loaders

🧪 Hands-on examples for customizing workflows

🛠️ Installation

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and install the required libraries:

pip install -U langchain-core langchain-mistralai langchain-community langchain-chroma

🚀 Usage

Clone this repo or open the notebook directly in Google Colab.

Get your Mistral API key from Mistral Console
.

Add the API key to your notebook secrets.

Run the cells step by step to experiment with translation, parsing, and summarization.
